File Transfer Application
Overview:
The File Transfer Application is a comprehensive Java-based tool designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of files between users. Utilizing both client-server architecture and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), this application ensures efficient and user-friendly file sharing. It caters to the needs of both authenticated and guest users, providing robust security features and a streamlined user experience.

Key Features:
Client-Server Architecture:

Sender Side:
The sender can select a file and specify the receiver's IP address.
The application sends the filename first, waits for the receiver's acknowledgment, and then transfers the file content.
It ensures the entire file is sent accurately, providing feedback during the process.
Receiver Side:
The receiver listens on a specific port for incoming connections.
Upon receiving a filename, the receiver can accept or reject the file.
If accepted, the file is saved in the designated directory chosen by the receiver.
User Authentication:

Users can create accounts with unique IDs and passwords.
The login mechanism ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features, enhancing security.
Guest users can also use the file transfer functionalities without an account, although it is not recommended for security reasons.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Built with Swing, the GUI provides a clear, user-friendly interface for all operations.
Different panels guide users through the login, signup, file selection, and transfer processes.
Visual elements like progress bars and text fields enhance the user experience.
File Selection and Directory Management:

Users can easily select files to send using a file chooser dialog.
Receivers can choose the destination directory to save incoming files, ensuring better file management.
